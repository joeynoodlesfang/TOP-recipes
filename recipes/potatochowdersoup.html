  <h2>Description</h2>
    
  <p>This is a creamy, cheesy potato chowder that's easy to make and delicious! Serve it in bread bowls if desired.</p>


  <h2>Ingredients</h2>  

  <ul>
    <li>2 cups peeled and diced potatoes</li>
    <li>½ cup diced carrots</li>
    <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>4 cups water, or as needed to cover</li>
    <li>2 cups milk</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter</li>
    <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 (15 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained</li>
    <li>2 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Place potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, and salt into a large pot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes; do not drain.</li>
    <li>When the vegetables are almost finished, combine milk, butter, and flour in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk constantly until butter melts and mixture is smooth and thick, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
