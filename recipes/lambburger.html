  <h2>Description</h2>
    
  <p>This lamb burger recipe was the best one I made when I bought a selection of lamb cuts from a CSA and got several one-pound packages of ground lamb. Top them with Dijon mayonnaise, tomato slices, and baby greens.</p>


  <h2>Ingredients</h2>  

  <ul>
    <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 4-inch sprig rosemary, chopped</li>
    <li>4 sprigs thyme, chopped</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>4 hamburger buns, split and toasted</li>
    <li>4 thick slices tomato</li>
    <li>1 cup baby mixed salad greens</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
    <li>Mix ground lamb, garlic powder, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. </li>
    <li>Shape mixture into 4 patties. </li>
    <li>Place patties on the preheated grill and cook until firm and slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Alternately, you can cook the patties to your desired degree of doneness. Rest patties while assembling toppings. </li>
    <li>Mix mayonnaise and mustard together in a small bowl. </li>
    <li>Spread 1 tablespoon on bottom of each hamburger bun; top each one with a lamb patty, tomato slice, and some greens. Sandwich with top bun to serve. </li>
  </ol>
